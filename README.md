# Clothes_Classification_Based_Sleeves
I applied transfer learning using a pre-trained Resnet50. Used the weights of imagenet. Fine-Tuned the ResNet50 on my cloths dataset.

After fine-tuning for 30 epochs got these results :

Train Accuracy: 82.03 %
Test Accuracy: 72.37 %

Final Trained weights are saved inside Weights directory.
